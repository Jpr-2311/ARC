    title: 'Noise Cancellation',
    desc: 'In a crowded classroom, café, or street — ARC still hears you clearly. WebRTC VAD (Voice Activity Detection) strips background noise in real time before your voice ever reaches the AI. Only clean, isolated speech gets processed.'

    num: '03',
    title: 'Voice Identity Verified',

    title: 'Whisper Transcribes',

    title: 'Gemini Understands Context',

    num: '06',
    title: 'Jarvis Acts on Your Laptop',
    desc: 'Jarvis runs as a background process 24/7 on your Mac. It can open and close apps, search and manage files, read and send emails, write code, build and deploy projects, set reminders, summarise PDFs — all through natural voice commands.'
  },
  {
    num: '07',
    title: 'Response Streams to Your Ear',
    desc: 'The reply is converted to speech using Mac\'s built-in Daniel voice and streamed via Bluetooth to your earphones connected to the wristband. You hear Jarvis respond naturally — with personality, humour, and context — within seconds of speaking.'

    num: '08',
    title: 'HUD for Verified Users Only',
    desc: 'If you\'re using ARC\'s visual HUD — a live camera overlay with face tracking and biometrics — it only activates and displays data for faces that pass voice or face verification. Unrecognised people see nothing. Your data stays yours.'
